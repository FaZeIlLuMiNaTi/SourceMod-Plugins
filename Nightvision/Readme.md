# Nightvision

A quick CSGO plugin that gives users nightvision goggles on spawn.

Idea came from a post I saw on [/r/GlobalOffensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4ix4cl/night_vision_exists_in_csgo_sv_cheats_protected/).

Drop the smx in /plugins, start the CSGO server, join a team and press F4.
